            <h2>(Very) Modern</h2>
            <p>Alicht makes use of several of the newest features that are now part of CSS. That includes flexboxes, CSS transforms, CSS animations, @media queries, and also a few minor properties.</p>
            <p>Because of that approach, please do note <strong>Alicht will only work with the most up to date browsers out there</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Keeping it simple.</h2>
            <p>I try not to get fancy when designing Alicht. That stands both for its design and for its features.</p>
            <p>I want Alicht to be a basic CSS framework out of the box. That means it will never pack as many components and layout possibilities as other popular frameworks.</p>
            <p>Alicht's main purpose is to try keep a <strong>balance between basic functionality, basic modularity, and a good appearance.</strong></p>
        </div>

            <h2>Open. Of course.</h2>
            <p>Alicht is on Github, so you probably guessed it already. What's important though is that I invite you to <a href="https://github.com/archost/alicht/issues">report</a> any issue/bug you might encounter using Alicht. Suggestions and ideas for improvements are welcome as well.</p>
